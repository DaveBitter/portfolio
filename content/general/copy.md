    value: >-
      I'm a Senior Front-end developer and Consultant with a background in both design and development. I have a rich experience in creating state of the art human-centred web applications using Next.js, React.js and the power of the web. Due to my diverse background, I take lead in projects to deliver the best quality of work, work multidisciplinary, guide others and am a point of contact for all.


      As a Developer Advocate, I'm continuously on the hunt to learn new techniques, tools and possibilities and share them. I revel in sharing the wonderful world of the web in the form of speaking at meetups, speaking at conferences, creating video content, writing articles and more.


      I get to enjoy my passion every day as a Developer Advocate & Front-end developer/Consultant and am excited about what the future will bring!
