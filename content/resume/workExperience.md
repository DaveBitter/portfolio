      At ANWB, I play a crucial role as a member of the Design System team, contributing to the development of the ANWB Design System - Poncho. This system is widely used by over 60 developers and 40 designers, supporting over a hundred web applications.


      My work involves two primary areas of focus. Firstly, I am responsible for providing major architectural solutions for the organization. This includes establishing a new way of working between development and design for design tokens through the Design System. I skillfully utilize my soft skills to get all stakeholders on board while also utilizing my technical expertise to develop solutions. I am essential in any major change in the ANWB's way of working, as it all starts with Poncho. This requires me to be versatile in various roles, including technical, business-focused, and other related areas.


      Secondly, I serve as a dependable support system to all front-end developers at ANWB. This includes providing assistance with questions regarding Poncho and providing input on development decisions in general.

      My experience at Mirabeau involved building interactive web applications and front-end component libraries while taking on various roles such as front-end developer, visual designer, interaction designer, back-end developer, and DevOps engineer. I primarily focused on building interactive web applications using React.js and Next.js while actively participating in the design and development process from start to finish.


      In addition to building web applications, I also worked on component libraries using HTML, CSS (SASS), and vanilla JS, which were used by development teams or standalone websites. I acted as a bridge between the design, front-end, and back-end teams, and became a valuable point of contact for a variety of stakeholders, using my natural confidence and communication abilities to take the lead successfully.


      Finally, my passion for knowledge sharing manifested in activities such as code reviews, presentations, articles, guest lectures, workshops, and meetups. I also coached front-end developers of all seniority levels, finding joy in helping others grow in a meaningful way.
