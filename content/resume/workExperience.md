      At Mirabeau, I am responsible for building interactive web applications and front-end component libraries. I touch the roles of front-end developer, visual designer, interaction designer, back-end developer and DevOps engineer daily. My main focus is building interactive (React.js and Next.js) web applications while being involved in the design and development process from front to back. This includes, but is not limited to:


      * crafting components together with visual and interaction designers

      * setting up front-end architectures

      * handling global states

      * handling data between front-end and back-end

      * ensuring accessibility

      * (consulting about) performance optimisations

      * search engine optimisation

      * setting up CI/CD

      * writing tests and documentation


      Next to that, I work on building component libraries with HTML, CSS (SASS) and vanilla JS. This can result in just a component library to be used by a development team or in a standalone website. Finally, I am an avid supporter of sharing knowledge. I do this regularly through giving code reviews, giving presentations, writing articles, giving guest lectures, giving workshops and speaking at meetups.

      At ViriCiti I was responsible for creating user experience and visual designs as well as building interactive real-time front-end data visualization and monitoring applications for electric vehicles and charging stations. As at Mirabeau, I touched the roles of front-end developer, visual designer, interaction designer, back-end developer and DevOps engineer daily.


      My main focus was building interactive (React.js and Node. js) web applications while being solely responsible for the design and process. I conducted user interviews, conducted user tests, worked on visual explorations, and designed components and defined an overall visual style for all products.


      I worked a good portion of the time in and with the back- end team as well. These tasks included, but were not limited to:


      * crafting components in the role of a visual designer, interaction designer and front-end developer

      * setting up front-end architectures

      * handling global states

      * handling data between front-end and back-end

      * handling data streams on both the front-end and back- end side

      * setting up CI/CD

      * writing tests and documentation

      I worked for Wallscope during a short-term project in the form of a code sprint as part of my studies. I worked for a project for the NHS regarding the visualisation of linked data. I got to work with the SPARQL Query Language, RDF and natural language processing.

      During my internship at Cohere, I build an interactive front-end application to view real-time data on the energy use and generation combined with the charging data of electric cars.

      * crafting components in the role of a visual designer, interaction designer and front-end developer

      * handling global states

      * handling data between front-end and back-end
