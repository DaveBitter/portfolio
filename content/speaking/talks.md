      Remix is a great framework to build robust, progressively enhanced and interactive web apps!


      During Covid we all missed the parties... therefore I will create my own party on stage. I will take you on a fun journey on how I created a multi-user and real-time progressive web app. But be aware, there is a guest list and not every solution is invited to join the party!


      I will show you how the Remix friend group will keep your party rocking:


      * where the state of your data is on the server where it belongs. (load some data and take action to get the party started).

      * where this multi-user web app is not dependent on complex client-side javascript (so even your drunk friend will understand it)

      * where the client-side is less error-prone (no party fouls wanted)

      * where the components are just plain stupid (no good story starts with a glass of milk)

      * where your application becomes simple and easy to understand (you know, for that friend)


      I will tell you about the challenges I encountered building this web app and how it was solved charmingly by using Remix. I will show you how Remix can be used for web apps with a lot of interactivity not just for plain websites with an occasional form.


      Getting FOMO? Make sure to sign up for the party and don’t miss out!

      We all know how you can add an OG image to your website. But did you know it is quite easy to generate custom, freshly designed and stateful images which make you stand out from the crowd? You might have seen this before. GitHub leverages this to create awesome images which show general info about your PR's. Curious, like me, how they did this? In this talk I will leverage the power of Next.js serverless function to generate these images on the fly!
